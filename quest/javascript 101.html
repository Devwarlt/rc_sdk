Javascript 101:

NOTE: To be extended.

text needs to be in quote ""
x = "bob"; 		//the variable x now holds value "bob";
x = 10; 		//the variable x now holds value 10.
x *= 5; 		//x is now 50.
x++;			//x is now 51

if(1 < 2){
	// code here will only be used if condition (1<2) is true
}

to test equality, use ===. to test non-equality, use !==

if(x === 51){
	x = 10;		// code here will only be used if condition (x is equal to 51) is true
}



if(x === 51 && y < 50)	//if x equals 51 AND y is less than 50
if(x === 51 || y < 50)	//if x equals 51 OR y is less than 50






###
Function: a prewritten part of code does a specific task

Functions take parameters to know on what the task must be applied to

Format:
	functionName(param0,param1,param2,...);

Ex: move(player1);		//move the player1
	move(player2);		//apply same task but on player2 instead




{attribute:value} is same than {'attribute':value} is same than {"attribute":value}
"abc" is same than 'abc'
object['attribute'] is same than object.attribute 
//comments that wont be used by computer
1 is same than true, 0 is same than false
