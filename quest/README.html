### Creating quest ####
This guide is about creating events for quests. 
This guide assumes you already know how to create map images and collisions grid. Check /map/creation for that.
This guide assumes you will use enemy/sprites/anim/icons already present in the game engine. 

You can check quest examples in the submissionExample folder. (RECOMMENDED)

####################################
In order to use any .html file in this SDK that starts with "test-" (ex: test-dialogue.html), drag the file into a new google chrome browser page.

####################################
A quest submission must include everything needed in order for the quest to work.

This can include:
-Map (Image, Grid, Events)
-Dialogue
-Items

Submission must include:
1- quest code (.js, file name is [yourQuestId].js) 
		This file contains info about dialogue, quest variables, maps, items etc...

2- map images (each map are in a separate folder. CHECK /map/creation for more info)
3- info.js (general information ex: author/date)

GAME ENGINE BASICS:

There are 3 types of entities that interacts with the player:
1- Actor: 	Enemy, Player, Npc, Switch, Block, Cuttable Trees, Doors 
2- Attack: 	Bullet, Strike
3- Drop: 	Items on the ground

The only entity we will use for quests is the ACTOR.

##################
QUEST CONCEPT:

A quest is a series of events the player must trigger.
Each event is represented by a function, a part of code that modifies the player progression in the quest.

Each quest event needs to be linked with a player action. 
It's via this player action that the player will trigger the event.

Examples:
	Quest event: Open locked door.
	Player Action: Activating a switch.
	
	Quest event: Start cutscene. 
	Player Action: Reaching position x=1000, y= 1000 in map "dragonLair".
	
	Quest event: Receive dragon head. 
	Player Action: Killing dragon.
	
	Quest event: Receive reward and finish quest. 
	Player Action: Talking with King.
	
The same quest event may be linked with multiple player actions.

Quest events can be accessed via q.event.  (Will be more clear later)

############

Player progression in a quest is saved in quest variables.
Each quest variable has a unique name.
Most quest events will access/modify those values.

Example:

custom quest variables list:
	"haveKilledDragon" (set default to false)

Quest event #1: 
	Set quest variable "haveKilledDragon" to true
	When
	Player Action: Kill dragon.
		
Quest event #2: 	
	if quest variable "haveKilledDragon" is true	=> 	Receive reward and finish quest. 
	if quest variable "haveKilledDragon" is false	=> 	Get nothing
	When
	Player Action: Talking with King.
	
Note: Each quest also has default variables: 
.active		(if the quest was started. you can only modify quest variables if the quest has been started by the player via the quest window. to open quest window for player: s.startQuest)
.complete	(if the quest is complete)
	
############
Maps contain the information about what actors to create. 
Some of these actors (ex: switch, dragon) may or may not be used for a quest event.

Each actors has a series of attributes that can be used to turn them into more than just a regular actor.

Ex:
.deathFunc	:	Call quest event when dying.
.dialogue	:	Call quest event when selecting talk option. Normally, this quest event will trigger a dialogue. 
				Choosing an option in the dialogue can also trigger a quest event.
.switch		:	Call quest event when selecting activate/deactivate option. 
.loot		:	Call quest event when selecting loot option. 

Full list can be found in /map.


############

Each account has multiple variables separated in two categories: player and quest.
	Player contains the same variables than regular monsters/actors. (Ex: hp, speed, attack, defence)

	Quest contains quest variables which track the current progression of all quests for a specify player.
	Each quest variable has an unique name. 

Each account has a unique id called "key".
In order for the game engine to know what account you want to access, you need to specify the "key" to use.
The key is always passed as the first parameter in any quest event you will create.


s.getAct(key) will access the player variables
	Ex: s.getAct(key).hp 		refers to the hp of the player corresponding to the key

s.get(key,'questVariableName') will access the quest variable	
	Ex:	s.get(key,'haveKilledDragon')		refers to the value of the quest variable named "haveKilledDragon" for the player with this key

s.set(key,'questVariableName',newValue) will change the value of a quest variable
	Ex: s.set(key,'haveKilledDragon',true)	changes the value of the quest variable named "haveKilledDragon" to true for the player with this key

	
Full list of commands can be found in /event.
