### Creating quest ####
This guide is about creating map events (quests). 
This guide assumes you already know how to create map images and collisions grid. Check /map/creation for that.
This guide assumes you're using sprites/anim/icons already present in the game engine. 

You can check quest example in the submissionExample folder. (RECOMMENDED)

####################################
PREPARATION: Install Nodejs server on your computer. Refer to /quest/preparation.

####################################
A quest submission must include everything needed in order for the quest to work.

This can include:
-Dialogue
-Map (Image, Grid, Events)
-Enemy
-Item


-Equip
-Ability
-Plan


Submission must include:
1- quest code (.js, file name is [yourQuestId].js) 
2- map images (each map are in a separate folder. CHECK /map/creation for more info)
3- info.js (general information ex: author/date)

GAME ENGINE BASICS:

Each account has multiple variables separated in two categories: player and main.

Player contains the same variables than regular monsters. (Ex: hp, speed, attack, defence)

Main contains variables that only "human players" have. (Ex: inventory, bank, preference)
The main also has the variable "quest" which track the current progression of all quests for a specify player.

Account variables can be accessed via a unique id called "key". 

List.main[key] will access the main variables.
List.actor[key] will access the player variables.

Ex: List.actor[key].hp refers to the hp of the player corresponding to the key

The key is always passed as the first parameter in any function you will create.

###

There are 3 types of entities that interacts with the player:
1- Actor: 	Enemy, Player, Npc, Switch, Block, Cuttable Trees, Doors 
2- Attack: 	Bullet, Strike
3- Drop: 	Items on the ground

This guide focuses mostly on actors.

Javascript 101:

text needs to be in quote ""
x = "bob"; 		//the variable x now holds value "bob";
x = 10; 		//the variable x now holds value x.
x *= 5; 		//x is now 50.
x++;			//x is now 51

if(1 < 2){
	// code here will only be used if condition (1<2) is true
}

###
Function: a prewritten part of code does a specific task

Functions take parameters to know on what the task must be applied to
Each function has information about what parameter to put and what the task the function does.

functionName(param0,param1,param2,...);

Ex: move(player1);		//move the player1
	move(player2);		//apply same task but on player2 instead




{attribute:value} is same than {'attribute':value} is same than {"attribute":value}
"abc" is same than 'abc'
object['attribute'] is same than object.attribute 
//comments that wont be used by computer
1/0 is infinity
1 is same than true, 0 is same than false
