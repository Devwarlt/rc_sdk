### Creating quest ####
This guide is about creating map events (quests). 
This guide assumes you already know how to create map images and collisions grid. Check /map/creation for that.
This guide assumes you're using sprites/anim/icons already present in the game engine. 

You can check quest example in the submissionExample folder. (RECOMMENDED)

PREPARATION: Install Nodejs server on your computer. Refer to /quest/preparation.

GAME ENGINE BASICS:

Each account has multiple variables separated in two categories: player and main.

Player contains the same variables than regular monsters. (Ex: hp, speed, attack, defence)

Main contains variables that only "real players" have. (Ex: inventory, bank, preference)
The main also has the variable "quest" which track the current progression of all quests for a specify player.

Account variables can be accessed via a unique id called "key". 

List.main[key] will access the main variables.
List.actor[key] will access the player variables.

The key is always passed as the first parameter in any function you will create.

###

There are 3 types of things that interacts with the player:
1- Actor: Enemy, Npc, Switch, Block, Cuttable Trees, Doors 
2- Attack: Bullet, Strike
3- Drop: Items on the ground

Actors are the most important ones for quests.

###
In Javascript:

{attribute:value} is same than {'attribute':value} is same than {"attribute":value}
"abc" is same than 'abc'
object['attribute'] is same than object.attribute 
//comments
1/0 is infinity
1 is same than true, 0 is same than false
