####################################
DIALOGUE:

All the dialogues are put inside a database. 
In order for the game engine to know which dialogue you want to use, you will need to identify the dialogue you have created with couple elements:

	1- Npc: 	Who is talking. 		
			Ex: bob
	
	2- Convo: 	What is the topic. 		
			Ex: Giving Quest
		
	3 - Node: 	Each line of speech. 	
			Ex: Ask the player if he wants to help him


Each node also has properties such as:

	Text:	What message is showed to the player.
			Ex: "Hello adventurers. How are you today?"
					
	Face:	Face appearing in the Chat Box when NPC talking (referring to Db.dialogue.face).	
			Ex: bobFace
				
	Option: List of choice given to the player. 
			Selecting an option will change the current dialogue. 
			Options can also trigger custom functions that will be used when making quests. (Ex: give an item)
	
	Func:	Quest Event to call when player accesses this dialogue
	
Each option has the properties:

	Text:	What is the text of the option
			Ex: "I'm fine. Thanks for asking."
	
	Next:	Reference to the next dialogue to display if the player chooses this option.
			Ex: {npc:'bob',convo:'introduction',node:'giveQuest'}
	
	Func:	Quest Event to call when player chooses this option

General Template:

q.dialogue['npcName'] = {
	convo0:{
		node0:{
			...
		},
		node1:{
			...
		},
		node2:{
			...
		},
	},
	convo1:{
		node0:{
			...
		}
	}
};

#################
Node Template:

## 1: Only text (no option):

node0:{
	text:"Hello",
},


## 2: Text with options and face (basic)

node0:{
	text:"Hello, how are you?",
	face:'bobFace',
	option:[
		{text:"Great.",
			next:{npc:'npcName',convo:'convo0',node:'node1'},
		},
		{text:"Bad.",
			next:{npc:'npcName',convo:'convo0',node:'node2'}
		},
	]
},


If the player choose the first option, it will start the dialogue in the node1.
If he chooses 2nd option, it will start node2.

If you don't specify the npc or the convo, it assumes you will stay with same npc and same convo.
Ex:			next:{node:'node1'},  

If next is not defined at all, the dialogue ends.


#############################
#### Quest Events #####

## 3: Text with options with quest events
The param "func" contains the quest event to trigger if the player chooses that option.

node0:{
	text:"Would you like to be teleported to the dragon lair?",
	option:[
		{text:"Yes.",
			func:q.event.teleportDragonLair
		},
		{text:"No."},
	],
},

### 

node0:{
	text:"Hello, how are you?",
	func:q.event.giveRing
}

Functions can also be directly linked with the node. (no options needed)
