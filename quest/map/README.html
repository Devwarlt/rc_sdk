Attack 

####################################
MAPS EVENTS:

By default, a map is just a plain image.
To bring life to the map, you will need to add an addon to it that will tell the engine what monsters/npc/lever to spawn.

When creating a quest, you might also want to modify a pre-existing map. 
To do that, you will create a new addon to pre-existing maps to modify them to your needs.

Always use the rc_sdk/map/creation/codeGenerator.html to get the addon template.

There are 3 different attributes for each addon: spot, load, loop.

ADVANCED: 
By default the name of the addon is your quest id.
There's a 4th attribute .variable that can contain any type of variable. Access it via this.variable in load or loop functions. 

####
.spot: Object
	List of position in the map.
	Spots should be generated automatically via Tiled by adding letters from the Tileset 9 on the map on the ZONE layer.	Check /map/creation for more info.
	
	spot will be the first parameter in the functions load and loop.
	A specific spot can be accessed via the "spot.[letter]".
	Ex: spot.a 	will contain the x, y and mapId of the letter 'a' in the tile project. (Note: spot['a'] is the EXACT same thing than spot.a)

####
.load: Function(spot)		
	This function will be called once when initializing the map.
	Used for: Create enemy, create npc, create switch, create block etc...

####
.loop Function(spot)	
	This function will be called every frame (25 times per second).
	Used for: Test collision that will trigger another event. Ex: Cutscene
	
######################
LOAD:

Create Actor: (Enemy, Npc, Switch, Block, Cuttable Trees, Doors)
	All actors have a specific template. When creating an actor, you need to specify the template to use.
	Each template has an id with 2 components: category and variant.
	
	List of template found in game engine in Link To Npc-Enemy
	In order to create an enemy that has different attribute than the template, you need to specify the differences in the "extra" parameter.
	
	## Basic Examples ##
	m.actor(
		spot.c,			//spot:		enemy will spawn where the 'c' is on the tile project
		"goblin",		//category:	template used will be the goblin-red one (assuming the template exists)
		"red",			//variant: 	
		{},				//extra:	enemy exactly the same than the template since extra is empty
	);
	m.actor(spot.c,"goblin","red",extra);
	
	m.actor(
		spot.c,				
		"goblin",		
		"red",
		{				//same enemy than above EXCEPT that this only has 9001 hp and moves slowly
			hp:9001,
			maxSpd:0.001,
		},					
	);
	
	In other to create a enemy that can respawn, the enemy needs to be in a group. Note: The group be be only 1 enemy.
	
	m.actorGroup(
		spot.e1,		//spot
		25*15,			//amount of frames before enemy group respawns (timer starts when last member is dead)
		[	
			[
				"orc",		//enemy category
				"melee",	//enemy variant
				2,			//amount
				{}			//extra is applied to every monster of this type in that subgroup
			],
			["orc","range",1,{deathEvent:q.event.killOrc}],		//other subgroup
			["orc","magic",5,{deathEvent:q.event.killOrc}],		//other subgroup
		]	
	);	
	m.actorGroup(spot.e2,25*15,[
		["orc","melee",1,{}],
		["orc","range",1,{}]
	]);	
	
	
	#####################
	## Extra Parameter ##
	The extra parameter is used to allow the actors to do various stuff:
			
	####
	Dialogue: 
		Can right-click to talk to. used to trigger dialogues. 
		PARAM: key
		---------------------
		dialogue:q.event.myDialogue,
				
		//An example of what the quest event could be:
		q.event.myDialogue = function(key){
			if(s.get(key,'haveKilledDragon') === true){
				s.dialogue(key,'Jenny','intro','intro2');
			} else {
				s.dialogue(key,'Jenny','intro','intro0');
			}		
		};
		
		
	####
	Event on Death (For Each killer):
		Call quest event for each player who dealt 1+ dmg to this monster when this monster dies
		PARAM: key | act: enemy who died object
		---------------------
		deathEvent:q.event.dragonKilled,
		
		//An example of what the quest event could be:
		q.event.dragonKilled = function(key,act){
			s.set(key,'haveKilledDragon',true);
		};		
				
	
	####
	ViewedIf
		condition to see the enemy. also affect collision (ex: if enemy is a block)
		
		PARAM: key | eid : enemy being seen id string
		RETURN: Boolean. Your quest event must return true if the player can see the npc, false otherwise.
		---------------------
		viewedIf:q.event.canSeeRock,
		
		//An example of what the quest event could be:
		q.event.canSeeRock = function(key,eid){
			if(s.get(key,'destroyedRock') === true){
				return false;
			} else {
				return true;
			}
		} 
	
	
	
	####
	Name
		Display name while moving mouse over the NPC.
		
		name:"Bob",
	
	####
	Sprite Name
		Change the look of a NPC
		
		"sprite,name":"villager-male1",
		
	####
	Combat?
		is the enemy in combat? being in combat means that he can perform attacks, be attacked and if its a monster, it can target/follow a player
		
		combat:false,
	
	####
	Move?
		can the enemy move?
		
		move:false,
	


		
	ADVANCED: For the full list of actor extra (not-related to quest), check /server/Actor.init.js
	
	
	####################
	Create a block line:
		Automatically create multiple actors (blocks) that like block the player. Useful for boss fight.
	
	m.block(
		spot.b1,				//needs to be a zone (not a single point) needs to be 1xn or nx1
		q.event.myCondition,	//viewedIf	(put null if no condition)
		'spike',				//sprite name (default is 'spike')
		{},						//extra
	);
	
	m.block(spot.b1,q.event.myCondition,'spike',{});
	
	####################
	Create a teleport:	(Door, Teleport Zone, staircase)
		Call quest event when player use the teleport option of this actor.
		
	m.teleport(
		spot.b1,						//spot
		q.event.teleportEvent,			//event called, normally teleporting the player	(PARAM: key | e: switch being clicked object)
		'zone',							//appearance ('zone','door','underground')
		{},								//extra	(ex: viewedIf)
	);
	m.teleport(spot.b1,q.event.teleportEvent,'zone',extra);
				
	//An example of what the quest event could be:
	q.event.teleportEvent = function(key,e,map){
		if(s.get(key,'doorLocked') === true){
			s.chat(key,"The door is locked.");
		} else {
			s.teleport(key,'dragonLair','t1');
		}
		
	};	
	
	####################
	Create a toggle (switch):
		Call quest event when player activate/desactivate this actor. 
		It starts in the "off" position. (Player activating it for first time will trigger "turnOn" event)
		
	m.toggle(
		spot.b1,						//spot
		q.event.displayOffCondition,	//event that RETURN BOOLEAN. if true, display the Off-Switch (the switch that will trigger the q.event.turnOn)
										//normally, if player hasn't activated it yet, it should return true.		(PARAM: key)		
		q.event.turnOn,					//event called when activating the Off-Switch		(PARAM: key | e: switch being clicked object | map: map object)
		q.event.turnOff,				//event called when desactivating the On-Switch		(PARAM: key | e: switch being clicked object | map: map object)
		{},								//extra for offSwitch
		{}								//extra for onSwitch
	);
	m.toggle(spot.b1,q.event.displayOffCondition,q.event.turnOn,q.event.turnOff,extraoffSwitch,extraonSwitch);
	
	//putting null for the "q.event.turnOff" means the switch can only be activated once
				
	//An example of what the quest event could be:
	q.event.displayOffCondition = function(key,e,map){
		return s.get(key,'doorLocked') === true;
	};
	q.event.turnOn = function(key,e,map){
		s.set(key,'doorLocked',false);
	};	
	q.event.seeDoor = function(key,e,map){			//linked to the door viewedIf (not the switch)
		return s.get(key,'doorLocked') === true;
	};	
	
	####################
	Create a loot (chest):
		Create an enemy that acts as a chest/loot. can only be looted once per player. 	
		
	
	m.loot(
		spot.b1,					//spot
		q.event.displayUnopened,	//event that RETURN BOOLEAN. if true, display the unopened chest
		q.event.openChest,			//event called when opening the chest		(PARAM: key | e: chest being opened object)
		'chest',					//appearance
		{},							//extra for chestOff
		{}							//extra for chestOn
	);
	m.loot(spot.b1,q.event.displayUnopened,q.event.openChest,'chest',extrachestOff,extrachestOn);
	
	//An example of what the quest event could be:
	q.event.openChest = function(key){
		if(s.testItem(key,'gold',1000) === true){	//if space for 1k gold
			s.addItem(key,'gold',1000);	
			s.set(key,"openedChest",true);
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
	} 
	q.event.displayUnopened = function(key,e,map){
		return s.get(key,'openedChest') === false;
	};	
	
	### ADVANCED:	This does the same thing.
	q.event.openChest = function(key){
		return s.testItem(key,'gold',1000,true,"openedChest");
	}
		
		
###################		
LOOP COMMON FUNCTIONS

####
Call Quest Event if player is in a zone:
	If a player is in that zone, call a quest event.
	
	m.collision(
		spot.a,					//spot zone. (should have been made with multiple letters in Tiled)
		q.event.damagePlayer		//quest event to call if in zone
	);
	
	//An example of what the quest event could be:
	q.event.damagePlayer = function(key){
		s.getAct(key).hp -= 100;
	} 
	
	
	
	
Everything in the loop function will be called every frame. 
However, for performance reasons, it is advised to use s.interval.

	s.interval(time)   return true every [time] frames.
	
Ex:
if(s.interval(100)){		//do something... every 100 frames (every 4 seconds)
	something...
}
	
Note: No need to use s.interval for m.collision.
