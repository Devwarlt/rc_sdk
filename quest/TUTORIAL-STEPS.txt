PREPARATION:
-Read all the READMEs...
-Download the full game engine and install the NodeJS server on your computer. Read /testing/README 
-Make sure the game engine works fine without your quest. Read /testing/README 

##### 
Just to make things clear, those 2 projects are COMPLETLY separated:
-SDK: Software development kit contains info about how to create stuff for the game. This is what you're reading atm.
		Modify files in the SDK will not affect the game. The SDK cannot run the game.
		https://github.com/RainingChain/rc_sdk
		
-GAME ENGINE: What the game needs to run: quest codes, map images, combat scripts etc...
	https://github.com/RainingChain/rainingchain	(Downloaded in the preparation above)

You create and test elements with the SDK. Once they are good, you move them to the game engine and test them again in the real game. 
#####	

Note: 
[QUESTID] refers to the id of your quest.
server refers to the game engine.
command line refers to the terminal (aka black window that pops when you click on STARTSERVER.bat)


#########################
PRE-TEST: 
Goal: Create a new "empty" quest. Once this will be done, we will add custom elements to the template.

-Move the "quest template BASIC.js" file in /server/db/quest on the game engine.
-Rename the file to the id of your quest. Ex: killDragon.js
-Open file /server/Db_quest.js in game engine.
-Add your quest id in the questList array.
-Change Quest.test.name = '[QUESTID]';
-Start server via STARTSERVER.bat
-Go to http://localhost:3000/ and log in with username:sam, password:sam.
-Upon logging, there should be a message saying: "You're currently working on the quest: [QUESTID]."

Problems: 
	ALWAYS CHECK THE COMMAND LINE FOR ERRORS. (Note: info - socketio message is normal)
	
	Can't access page: try starting again from scratch (remove quest from questList and Quest.test).
						if works: problem with quest, read error
						if doesn't work: problem with engine.
	No message upon logging: Make sure quest is in the questList and Quest.test = [QUESTID]
	
If you have received the message, move on to next step :D
	


#########################
DRAFT:

-Dress the list of action the player must perform to complete the quest.
-Dress the list of maps you will need to create/edit and what they will have.
-Dress the list of main dialogues and npc.	

#########################
CODING IN MINIMIZED ENVIRONMENT (SDK):
Note:	Main things refers to things essential for completing the quest.
		Template refers to the file located in /server/db/quest that you renamed to [QUESTID].js. (Original name was quest template BASIC.js)

In this step, you will use the SDK to verify that what you wrote is good.		
		
-Write down list of main quest events, what they do and how they will be triggered in the template.
-Write the JS code for them with the functions found in quest/event/README.

-Write down the main dialogues.
-Test the dialogues via /quest/dialogue/test-dialogue.html

-Copy-paste the dialogues in the template.
-Test the quest via the /quest/event/test-event.html file.

ONCE THE QUEST WORKS, you will move the real game engine.

#########################
CODING IN MID ENVIRONMENT (MINIMIZED GAME ENGINE):

In this step, you will use a minimized game engine to verify that what you wrote is good:
Difference with normal engine:
-Monsters can't be attacked. Instead, they can be killed by right-clicking and selecting "Kill" instead. (To trigger deathFunc)
-Challenge, highscore, requirements, chrono, etc... will do nothing.
-There's only 1 map with everything in it. s.teleport will do nothing.
	Instead of using the q.map or q.mapAddon, you will use q.minimizedMap which is a simplified version for maps.
###

-Open /server/Db_quest.js in game engine and make sure that Quest.test.minimized = true;
-Code the items you will use and add them to the template. Check /quest/item

-Code the q.minimizedMap in the template. Check /quest/map/minimizedMap.txt

-Run the server and test the quest. You should be able to complete it at this point.

#########################
CODING IN REAL ENVIRONMENT (GAME ENGINE):

-Create the maps using Tiled. Check /quest/map.	(This is a long process.)
Don't forget that if you have created map images, create a new folder at server/client/img/map/[mapId] and place them there.
-Code the q.map and q.mapAddon and put them in the template. You will use the real s.actor now.
-Complete the quest.

If still working, start working on completing all quest events for things like:
-viewedIf
-_hint
-_abandon, _complete, etc...
-No possible abuse.

#########################
POLISHING:
-Add non-essential map decoration.
-Add non-essential dialogue.
-Add non-essential enemies.
-Test the final version of the quest.
