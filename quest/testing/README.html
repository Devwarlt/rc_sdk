################## TESTING YOUR QUEST ##################
Note: ALWAYS TEST THE QUEST via the test-event.html file FIRST. If your quest doesn't work there, it won't work in the game either.

In order to add the quest you have created to the game: 

1- Place your [questId].js file in the /server/db/quest folder.
2- Open the Db_quest.file located under /server/db/
3- Add your questId in the questList array.
4- If you have created map images, create a new folder at server/client/img/map/[mapId] and copy them there.
5- The function TestingQuest will be called upon login. 
	It can be used to teleport your player near the quest starting location.
	Or adding items/modifying quest variables...
	
6- Start the server.
7- Log in with username: sam and password: sam.
8- Test the quest.

ADVANCED:
You can modifying anything on the client directly by using the Google Chrome console (F12).
To modify something on the server, you need to use the console and use the function:
	ts('string containing what you want to do');

	You have access to any variable including:
	key,
	p: player object,
	m: main object,
	mq: quest variables
	
	Ex:
		ts('p.x = 1000; p.y = 200;');
		ts('mq.QquestId.haveKilledDragon = true');

(Obviously, this function only works on the public testing server.)
In the console, you need to use the "real" functions used by the game engine.	(Ex: Itemlist.add instead of s.addItem)
